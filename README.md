automaton
=========

Allows you to perform various actions on a host PC remotely such as starting up Media center and switching display mode to TV-Out. Automaton runs as an http server and can be acccessed via any device capable of running a web browser, including the Applie IPod Touch and IPhone. New Automated actions can also be added via the simple plugins system.
< b="">With windows 7 the display switching for media center/XBMC works out of the box, however with Windows Vista and XP you will have to open MediaCenterPlugin.MediaCenterPlugin.xml and change the values as indicated.
